# AgroGuardian
Greetings Everyone,
I’m happy to share my experience from the 1st project assignment of my ongoing virtual internship at Feynn Labs AI Incubator, guided by my mentor, Mr. Sanjay Basumatary.
During this project, I developed my idea titled “AgroGuardian — Smart Pest & Disease Monitoring Network.”

💡 About the Task
As part of the AI Product/Service Ideation activity, I had to:
- Identify a problem faced by a small or medium-sized business.
- Apply Machine Learning / Data Science to improve operations, marketing, or sales.
- Design an abstract prototype and business model showing how AI can solve real-world issues.
  
🌾 Why I Came Up with AgroGuardian
- Coming from an agricultural background, I’ve seen how pest infestations cause huge losses for small farmers.
- Most solutions available are too expensive or complex for local farmers.
- I wanted to build something affordable, practical, and tech-driven to support them.

🤖 How AgroGuardian Works
- Uses AI-powered camera traps to detect crop pests and diseases early.
- Sends real-time alerts and treatment suggestions via mobile app/SMS.
- Helps farmers make data-backed decisions and reduce pesticide overuse.
  
🌱 Impact on Business & Society
- Enables small and medium farmers to adopt smart farming easily.
- Improves yield, reduces costs, and supports eco-friendly practices.
- Promotes sustainable agriculture using accessible AI tools.
  
💡 With AgroGuardian, small farmers can detect issues early, save resources, and increase productivity — using the power of AI for Agriculture!
